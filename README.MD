# Data Viz 4 Fun!

This repo serves as a storage container for random data visualisations I've created for reasons stretching from testing out new techniques to sheer boredom. All of the code here is provided as open-source in good faith under the conditions that: (1) use of the original sources of data remains appropriate and is acknowledged; and (2) the use of the code and/or data from this repository is acknowledged.

I'm also more than happy for people to reach out to me to ask any questions about this work. I'm most easily accessible on Twitter through [@aaron_s_fox](https://twitter.com/aaron_s_fox).

### Triple J's Hottest 100s of the 2010s

Code | Visualisation ***[TODO: add links]***

For those unfamiliar, Triple J's Hottest 100 is a yearly institution of Australian music - and is cited as the world's largest musical democracy. Each year Australia's favourite songs from the Triple J radio station are voted on by the people to determine the 'hottest' 100 of the year. At the end of the 2010s, Triple J also held a Hottest 100 of the decade where votes were cast for the best songs of the past 10 years.
